# Terminal Donut
3D Spinning Donut in the Terminal. Because I can.

## Context
I found a blog post through Reddit detailing how to make a 3D donut in the terminal, and I wanted to read through the post and understand the logic of the code. I just finished a linear algebra class, and this was a great way for me to practice application of the knowledge. You can find the blog post [here](https://www.a1k0n.net/2011/07/20/donut-math.html).

3Blue1Brown's [YouTube playlist on Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) was an amazing help in understanding the intuition behind the linear alebra concepts required to comprehend the code, so I highly recommend you check it out. More specifically, videos 4, 5, and 9 were the most relevant.

This project only took a few hours to complete, but was one of the most educational project I've undertaken, so if you're interested, you should definitely give it a try.

## How to Run
Compile `donut.c` on your machine, and then run the resulting executable.
```bash
$ gcc donut.c -o donut -lm
$ ./donut
```
